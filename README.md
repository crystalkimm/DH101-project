This is the repisitory for my DIGHUM 101: Practicing the Digital Humanities project.


## Abstracts
### Individual Project
For my individual project, I researched podcasts in the context of 2020. Knowing that podcasts have become popular over the past few years, I wanted to see how influential they are and identify any shifts in listening patterns over the past few months that may correlate with other shifts in social media due to major events such as the outbreak of COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter Movement. The purpose of this project is to observe whether podcast trends reflect current events and to create an overview of 2020 through podcasts. I produced topic model visualizations for each month of the year (up to June) to see how the common topics of popular podcast episodes changed over time. 

### Group Project
In our group, Annie Zeng, Malcolm Devoe, Rishabh Parekh, and I focused on societal biases in the digital humanities. We read “Critical Questions for Big Data” by Danah Boyd and Kate Crawford, “Why I Dig: Feminist Approaches to Text Analysis” by Lisa Rhody, “Making a Case for the Black Digital Humanities” by Kim Gallon, and “The Digital Humanities Debacle” by Nan Z. Da. Through this project, we aimed to understand what biases exist in the field of the digital humanities. We looked at different perspectives to learn how inclusivity or gender and racial diversity in this field makes a significant impact on research topics as well as methods used for digital humanities analysis.
